      <subfield code="a">Original and reproduction manuscript/transcript materials document periods in the lives of three Georgetown residents who were owners and residents of one of Georgetown’s storied landmarks, Evermay :&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
    Samuel Davidson (c 1747 – 1810), a real estate speculator and part-owner of the land where the White House stands, began construction of Evermay in 1792.&#13;
    Lewis Grant Davidson (1779 - 1832), second owner of Evermay, inherited the Georgetown property at 1623 28th Street, NW from his uncle Samuel Davidson upon condition that he add “Davidson” to his name.  Lewis’ name change made him the first resident of the nation’s capital to take another name legally and required a special act of Congress, signed into law by President James Madison.&#13;
    Samuel Grant Davidson (1822 – 1893), never married son of Lewis Grant Davidson and his wife Eliza (Crawford) Davidson.&#13;
