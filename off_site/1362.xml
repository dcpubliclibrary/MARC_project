      <subfield code="a">Processing Information: The images were removed from their original housing. Each image was assigned a number and placed in an individual polypropylene sleeve. The images were then placed in an acid-free folder and stored in an archival storage box. The box was then placed in the DC Community Archives for long-term storage. Negatives were assigned a number that directly corresponded to the print and placed in individual archival sleeves. Additionally, the collection name and some intellectual information was added to the sleeve. The negatives were then placed in an archival box and placed in the negative cabinet for long-term storage.</subfield>

      <subfield code="a">The collection consists of thirty 4x5 black and white photographs each with a corresponding negative. Photographers Anice Hoachlander and Harlan Hambright in 1987 took these images to document buildings on 500 block of 9th Street and the 900 block of E Street in northwest Washington. These buildings were torn down to make way for a larger office building.</subfield>

The box they were stored in was sent to David Maloney at Historic Preservation from the Quadrangle Development Corporation. There is no indication that either one of these organizations donated the images to the DC Community Archives and/or Washingtoniana.</subfield>
