      <subfield code="a">In 1979 a Statehood Initiative was presented to D.C. residents for a vote to approve legislation that would begin a concerted effort to make the District a state.  The Statehood Initiative won approval on November 4, 1980 and became the first public referendum passed in the City's history.  The final enabling legislation, D.C. Law 3-171, as amended D.C. Code Sec. 1-115(b) (1987)), provided for the creation of two commissions -- the D.C. Statehood Commission and the D.C. Compact Commission.  The Statehood Commission was to "educate, promote, and advance the proposition of statehood for the District of Columbia in the District and elsewhere."  The Compact Commission was given the responsibility to conduct a "full and complete study of the necessary and appropriate legislative and administration action" to achieve statehood.  The two commissions consisted of three commissioners from each of the eight wards in the District who were appointed by the D.C. City Council. 

One of the more important provisions of the Initiative called for a Constitutional Convention and the writing of a Constitution for the State of New Columbia   On November 4, 1981 forty-five delegates were elected to a Constitutional Convention to serve two or three-year terms.  The convention delegates drafted a constitution by May 29, 1982, which was subsequently adopted by a majority vote of D.C. citizens on November 2, 1982.    In 1985 after the three-year term of the Constitutional Convention expired, the two Commissions became one.  

 
As part of its mandate to "educate, promote, and advance" statehood, the Commission engaged in a number of activities throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Among others things, it designed a curriculum for public schools, established training sessions for D.C. teachers, testified before Congress on statehood legislation, and established a Statehood Resource Center.   Congress did not vote on the D.C. Statehood bill, which was originally introduced by Walter Fauntroy as H.R. 51 in 1987, until November 1993.  The bill was defeated by a vote of 277 to 153. The Commission's budget was dramatically decreased and activities were severely curtailed after the defeat.
