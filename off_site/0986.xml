      <subfield code="a">In 1979 D.C. residents were presented with a proposal to vote on a Statehood Initiative that would approve legislation to begin an effort to grant D.C. statehood. The Statehood Initiative won approval on November 4, 1980 and became the first public referendum passed in the District’s history. The final enabling legislation, D.C. Law 3-171, as amended D.C. Code Sec. 1-115(b) (1987)), provided for the creation of two commissions - the D.C. Statehood Commission and the D.C. Compact Commission. The D.C. Statehood Commission’s mission was to educate, promote, and advance the proposition of statehood in the District and elsewhere. The D.C. Compact Commission’s mission was to conduct a study of the necessary and appropriate legislative and administration actions needed to achieve statehood. The two commissions consisted of three commissioners from each of the eight wards in the District, appointed by the D.C. City Council. A provision of the Initiative called for a Constitutional Convention and the writing of a Constitution for the State of New Columbia. On November 4, 1981 45 delegates were elected to a Constitutional Convention. The convention delegates drafted a constitution by May 29, 1982, which was adopted by a majority vote of D.C. citizens on November 2, 1982. In 1985 after the three-year term of the Constitutional Convention expired, the two Commissions were combined.  The Commission engaged in a number of educational and promotional activities throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. Activities included designing a curriculum for public schools, providing training for D.C. teachers, testifying before Congress on statehood legislation, and establishing a Statehood Resource Center. Walter Fauntroy introduced the D.C. Statehood Bill, H.R. 51, in 1987; however Congress did not vote on the bill until November 1993 and it was defeated by a vote of 277 to 153. The Commission's budget was decreased and activities reduced after the defeat.</subfield>
