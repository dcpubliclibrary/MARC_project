      <subfield code="a">The school newspaper, Tech Life, dates back to 1902 when the school was established as a technical school for white students.  Named after the 25th U.S. President, William McKinley, it has a rich history with deep roots in “manual training” programs that were set up for working-class youths in the 1880s.  The school was moved to a new building in 1928 at Second and T Streets (NE), and an addition was constructed in 1957.  The school closed in 1997 and was scheduled to re-open in 2002.  However, funding and construction delays hampered the project.  It re-opened in August 2004, partly due to the fulfillment of a campaign promise of Mayor Anthony A. Williams.</subfield>
