      <subfield code="a">The Women's City Club was founded in 1919 and was the first local club for women with a meetinghouse.  The Club took positions on issues such as home rule, women's suffrage, and abolition of capital punishment.   It was part of a national and international network of women's groups and became a part of the D.C. Federation of Women's Clubs in 1920.</subfield>

      <subfield code="a">Most of the items in this collection were originally part of the Washingtoniana Division’s vertical files, a set of files maintained for ease of reference on various topics related to D.C. history and current events.  The vertical files primarily contain clippings but also include other rare items such as signed letters, original programs, and reports.  To ensure the physical preservation of rare documents in the vertical file on the Women’s City Club of Washington, DC were removed in 1999 to create this collection.  Photocopies of clippings and other less rare items were retained in the vertical file.</subfield>
