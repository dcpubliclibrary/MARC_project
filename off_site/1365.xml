      <subfield code="a">Processing Information: After exhibition the portrait panels were accessioned into the DC Community Archives collection and placed in archival storage boxes. In 2006, sheets of buffer paper were placed between each image for added protection and the boxes were returned to the DC Community Archives for long-term storage.</subfield>

      <subfield code="a">The collection consists of 156 8x10 portraits, of which only one is in black &amp; white. The images were used in an exhibit entitled Washington’s Millennium Leaders – Through the Bachrach Lens, which was on display at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library from January 24, 2002 through April 2002. During that time two images, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Armstrong Williams, were stolen and never recovered. Bachrach Studios was asked to replace the missing images, however the request from Ms. Haskins went unanswered. Each portrait is matted and permanently mounted between sheets of mat board. As part of the exhibit, each person’s names and affiliations have been placed on each mounting. The collection is arranged alphabetically by surname, which is believed to be the exhibits original order.</subfield>
