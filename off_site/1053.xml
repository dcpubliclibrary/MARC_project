      <subfield code="a">The Capitol Hill Symphony Society was established on January 30, 1964 at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Washington, DC.  The Society was created “for the purpose of providing ‘support for musical activities in the city of Washington, particularly…Capitol Hill.’”  It was incorporated as a non-profit organization and was the main source for the newly founded Capitol Hill Symphony Orchestra.  The Orchestra, directed by Victor King, was initially made of 90 members, was racially integrated, and was entirely voluntary.  The Orchestra’s debut concert was held on March 8, 1964 at St. Mark’s (3rd and A Street, SE).  

The initial concept for the Society and Orchestra was born out of the Gault String Ensemble, which was a contributor to the St. Elizabeths Hospital music therapy program.  The program gave patient at the hospital a means to express their musical talents.  The String Ensemble was incorporated into the Capitol Hill Symphony Society and the music therapy program continued.  It is unclear how for how long the Society was in existence.  

The CHS Orchestra should not be confused with the Capitol City Symphony Orchestra (formerly the Georgetown Symphony Orchestra).
