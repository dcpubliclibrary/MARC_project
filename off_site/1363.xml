      <subfield code="a">The theatre opened in 1926 and was designed by John J. Zink. In the 1940s and 1950s the single screen theatre was operated by Warner Brothers studio. In the mid-1970s the theatre housed the DC Black Repertory Theatre Company. After the company folded in the late 1970s the building remained vacant for more than a decade. In 1987 a group began an effort to convert the theatre into apartments, however several setbacks delayed the opening until 1995. The images in this collection are from the period in the 1980s when the theatre was vacant.</subfield>
