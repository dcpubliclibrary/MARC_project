      <subfield code="a">Greg Reynolds, a native of Anacostia, trained in the District with Erika Thimey and Batya Heller.  He earned a B.A. at Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York and received a scholarship to study with Alvin Ailey, specializing in liturgical dance.  From 1973-1976, he was a member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and traveled throughout the United States and Europe.  In 1976, he founded the Greg Reynolds Quintet, a multi-ethnic modern dance company that had its initial performance in Moscow.  The Quintet, which lasted until 1984, engaged in a variety of performances, including concerts-in-the-schools, workshops, liturgical dance, and public service events in local, national, and international venues.  Mr. Reynolds was also associate choreographer for the Omega Liturgical Dance Company. Throughout his dance career, Reynolds was particularly active and interested in bringing dance and the arts to students. In the District he worked with Meridian House International, the D.C. Public Library, DC Public schools, and local arts organizations to bring dance to local students.   He also taught and conducted a workshop titled “dance conversations” with the Quintet in many U.S. cities in the 1970s.  In 1981, he was appointed for a three-year term to the D.C. Commission on the Arts.</subfield>
