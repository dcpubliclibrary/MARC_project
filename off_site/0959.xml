      <subfield code="a">Self-Determination for D.C. coalition was formed as the result of the adoption of a resolution in January 1971 by the Americans for Democratic Action calling for the formation of a national coalition to promote home rule and congressional voting representation for the District of Columbia. Initially the Coalition was called the Democracy for D.C. Committee and consisted of 25 local and national groups along with several city residents. Richard W. Clark, a special assistant to the president of Common Cause, and Victor Reuther, a labor leader, agreed to serve as national co-chairman. In the fall of 1971 a metropolitan steering committee was formed of local organizations with Sterling Tucker and Marne Hornblower serving as co-chairmen. The coalition was instrumental in lobbying for and campaigning for home rule legislation and a constitutional amendment providing for congressional representation in Congress. The coalition disbanded in 1985. </subfield>
