      <subfield code="a">The collection consists of 33 albumen card mounted portraits. These types of images come in a wide variety of styles and sizes. Among the more popular were the cabinet card and carte de visite (CDV). The majority of the images where mounted on standardized mounts roughly measuring 4 ¼” x 6 ½” for cabinet card and 2 ½” x 4 ¼” for the CDVs. In addition to these formats there was also an assortment of larger decorative mounts that gained popularity during the Victorian era. The image itself is often an Albumen print, which is a process by which the emulsion was developed on very thin sheets paper, and was then pasted to the cardboard mounts.</subfield>
