      <subfield code="a">The Washington Housing Association (WHA) was organized in 1933 as the Washington Committee on Housing to improve housing for low-income residents in the District. WHA sponsored the Alley Dwelling Elimination Act of July 1934. Charlotte Everett Hopkins, a long-time crusader for the passage of the Act, was instrumental in the formation of WHA. Eleanor Roosevelt served as WHAâ€™s honorary chairman; Frederic A. Delano was the first chairman; and John Ihlder, a nationally recognized housing activist, was the first secretary. WHA fought for a sound housing code, to insure construction of low-rent housing, and encourage landlord responsibility to tenants. WHA became the Washington Planning and Housing Association in 1962 and later the Metropolitan Washington Planning and Housing Association. In the 1960s the Association assisted residents dislocated by urban renewal, freeway construction, and downtown development find affordable housing. </subfield>
