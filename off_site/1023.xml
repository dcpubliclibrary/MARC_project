      <subfield code="a">The first Christmas Tree lighting ceremony in Washington, DC occurred during the Woodrow Wilson administration in 1913 at the U.S. Capitol.  The first tree lighting at the White House occurred at the Ellipse in 1923 during the Calvin Coolidge administration.  The tree lighting ceremony moved from the Ellipse to Sherman Park from 1924 to 1933.  In 1934 the tree was moved to Lafayette Park and the ceremony continued there until 1939 when it was returned to the Ellipse.  From 1941 to 1953 the tree was located on the grounds of the White House.  In 1954 it was permanently moved to the Ellipse and the ceremony has taken place there since.</subfield>
