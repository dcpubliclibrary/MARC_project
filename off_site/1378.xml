      <subfield code="a">The collection consists of 86 packages of strip negatives. Some packages contained multiple negatives bringing the total number of strip negatives to 97. The strip negatives contain between one and seven images, which brings the total number of images in the collection to 372. According to the hand written note, the donation of the negatives occurred shortly after the publication of her third book, Washington: Portrait of the Capital (1972, Barre Publishers). After processing the collection it became clearly evident eighty-five or more of these did in fact appear in her book. All images were taken by Ms. Mitchell and range in date from the mid-1960s thru 1975 (year of donation).  Images are of scattered locations throughout the city, however there are areas of concentration including the Capitol building, Chinatown, Dupont Circle, National Mall, and Lafayette Square.</subfield>
