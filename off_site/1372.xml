      <subfield code="a">Processing Information: The slides were removed from their original boxes. Each box of slides was assigned a title, then corresponding slides were placed into individual acid-free compartments and stored in an archival box. Three of the empty slide boxes were kept for archival purposes and stored along with the slides. The box was then placed in the DC Community Archives for long-term storage. Digital scans of the slides were created by Alice R. Makl and transferred to DC Public Library on a flash drive.  The high resolution jpegs were ingested into the archival repository and cataloged for publication in the public digital collections website, Dig DC. The one original 8x10 black and white photograph was placed in an acid-free folder in an archival box which contains images from the Photograph Collections of: Charles Suddarth Kelly, Metro, Unity Brick Company, Washington Navy Yard, Hambright &amp; Hoachlander, Colony Theatre, and Jackson Pace Complex.</subfield>

      <subfield code="a">Native Washingtonian and lifelong resident of Washington, D.C., Dr. Darrell Clayton Crain Jr. (1910-1995) dedicated 50 years of his life to the practice of medicine. After graduating from the George Washington University School of Medicine and completing residency at Emergency Hospital, Dr. Crain served as Medical Officer at Walter Reed General Hospital before entering private practice in 1937. Notable achievements in his field include co-founding the Arthritis Rehabilitation Center in Washington, founding of the Rheumatology Clinic at Georgetown University Hospital, serving in professional and civic societies, and writing several books.  Dr. Crain was a rheumatologist by profession and photographer by hobby. While in his home of Washington, D.C. and traveling the country and abroad, he documented his experiences on film, leaving behind vibrant, color photographs that give a vivid glimpse of the past. From family vacations to the aftermath of the 1968 riots in Washington, D.C. to professional travel in Monaco, Dr. Crain captured candid and intimate historical moments over the span of four decades.</subfield>
