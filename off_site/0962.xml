      <subfield code="a">The Dupont Park Civic Association was founded in the 1960s to combat neighborhood crime and to promote the civic welfare of the community.  The primary goals of the charter were neighborhood improvement, property maintenance, and increased police protection.  The association became involved with the Home Rule Committee in December of 1964 as well as the Far Northeast Council of Civic Associations (1965) in establishing a program for community action against poverty.  

The crime-watch campaigns of the 1960s, which began with an increase of local police involvement, developed into the Neighborhood Watch committees of the 1980s. The association also became involved with the ANC 7D and other local civic associations to protest the District’s proposed creation of drug treatment facilities and homeless shelters within the surrounding residential boundaries.</subfield>
