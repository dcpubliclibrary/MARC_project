      <subfield code="a">Between 1997 and 1999 the D.C. Public Library and Councilmember Hilda Mason's office jointly sponsored a program to conduct oral histories of D.C. Statehood movement leaders. The project was funded by a grant from the D.C. Humanities Council and documents the experiences of 10 important Statehood movement leaders. The interviews cover such topics as memories of activist Julius Hobson, the early founding of the Statehood Party, local politics and referendums, constitutional convention, and the defeat of the statehood legislation. After the completion of the project the Library held  a Statehood Forum at the Library and an audio recording of that event is also included with this collection.</subfield>
