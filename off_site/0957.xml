      <subfield code="a">Mrs. Ellis became a citizen activist after urban renewal forced her in 1959 to relocate the restaurant started by her late husband, Cy Ellis, from Southwest Washington, D.C.   She was again forced to move from a second location at E Street, N.W., when metro began construction there in the 1960s.   Her ten-year fight in the courts and Congress helped establish the "priority law" which requires that long-established businesses can use the "grandfather" clause to avoid relocation in urban renewal areas.  Mrs. Ellis moved her restaurant back to the redeveloped Southwest waterfront in 1970.  Born on a Potomac River farm in St. Mary's County, Maryland, she married and moved to Washington, D.C. with her husband sometime after World War I to start his oyster bar restaurant.</subfield>
