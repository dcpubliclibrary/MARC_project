      <subfield code="a">The National Rifles, an independent company of the D.C. Militia, was organized in 1859 in the wake of John Brown’s raid.  It was the first company of citizen troops ordered into the Civil War in 1861.  A few years after the War, the militia disbanded or merged with other troops. The National Rifle Armory was located on G Street between 9th and 10th at the site of the current Mather Building, directly across from the MLK Library.  Members of the company formed a veteran’s organization to hold annual reunions, fairs, soirees, dinners, and other events to commemorate the anniversary of their founding and military service.</subfield>
