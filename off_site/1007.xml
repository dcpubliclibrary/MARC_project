      <subfield code="a">In 1790, the Federal City was established out of land ceded from Maryland and Virginia.  For the next 10 years, the Federal City was policed by law enforcements officers from those two states.  In 1802, the city was given the power to enforce its own laws, although this was to be accomplished with only 15 officers.  In 1861, the Metropolitan Police Department was established and continues to this day.  The first arrest under the Metropolitan Police Department was for a charge of intoxication (Source: Metropolitan Police Department Website: Brief History of the MPDC)</subfield>
