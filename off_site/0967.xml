      <subfield code="a">In March of 1910 representatives from 22 established citizens' associations met to form an alliance to represent their combined interests before Congress, the President, and the D.C. government.   William Clayton, Allen Davis, and Charles Lancaster were some of the key founders of the Federation.  The Federation has championed a number of interests over its history, including establishment of the Public Utilities Commission, voting rights for D.C. citizens’ congressional representation as well as working on issues affecting transportation, police, fire, fiscal matters, environment, and education in the City.  Historically the membership of citizens associations has been white.</subfield>
