      <subfield code="a">In order to promote environmental conservation and horticultural interest, area residents founded the Cleveland Park Garden Club in 1953. Topics at the monthly meetings ranged from garden maintenance to community beautification projects. Slide and lecture presentations as well as garden tours were held throughout the year.  The club was also active in local volunteer and civic efforts including the maintenance of the National Cathedral grounds, the safeguarding of “green spaces” in the District, and the Cleveland Park Branch Library Landscaping and Beautification project. The group also protested the District’s use of DDT as a pesticide.

Although the club was advertised as a community organization for both men and women, membership was primarily female.  When the club disbanded in June of 1984, the decline in membership was attributed not only to District families’ exodus to the suburbs but also to women working outside the home.</subfield>
