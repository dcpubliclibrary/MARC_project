      <subfield code="a">From 1992 â€“ 1993, a total of 12 oral history interviews were conducted through the Eastern Market Oral History Project, of which the Washingtoniana division holds resources for 9 interviews. The goal of the project was to capture the undocumented history of the Eastern Market, the last vestige of the Washington market system, which for more than 100 years played a vital role in the life of the city. The stories told by the interviewees show the important role that public markets played in feeding the city throughout the 19th and early 20th century, providing work and a social gathering place while connecting the city and its people to the surrounding countryside. Topics include family history, business, relations between vendors, and neighborhood and industry changes over time. The project was done under a planning grant from the D.C. Community Humanities Council, and Valerie Pawlewicz served as project manager.</subfield>
