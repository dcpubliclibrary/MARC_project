      <subfield code="a">Hilda Howland Mae Mason was born in Altavista, (Lynch Station, Virginia) on June 4, 1916. She attended Virginia Seminary in Lynchburg and St. Paul's College in Lawrenceville. Mason relocated to Washington, DC in 1945. She later enrolled at Miners Teachers College and earned her undergraduate degree in 1952. She was a teacher, counselor and administrator in the DC public school system for 19 years, until she was elected to the Board of Education from Ward 4. She served from 1972-1977, after which she was appointed to complete the term of Julius Hobson, Sr., the at-Large member of the DC City Council. After completing Hobson’s term, she won an at-Large seat on her own merit. Mason was a champion of education in DC as chair of the Council’s Education, Libraries and Recreation Committee (1981-1997), the Local, Regional and Federal Affairs Committee, the Human Services Committee, and the Judiciary Committee. To date, her tenure on the City Council remains the longest term of service in the city’s history. Mason was also a steadfast member of the DC Statehood Party, as well as a supporter of the development of the University of the District of Columbia. The law school library bears her name and the name of her husband, Charles N. Mason, Jr., a graduate of Harvard University and Howard University Law School.</subfield>
