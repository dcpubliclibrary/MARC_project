Tapes were duplicated by the Library with the original being placed into off-site deep storage, and patrons given access to the use copy. In 2014, the transcripts and the tapes were digitized. Following digitization the collection was reprocessed in 2017 with the transcripts being placed in new folders and boxed. Tapes were divided based on format (cassette and reel-to-reel, and boxed for long-term storage. All administrative documents, including releases, were placed into the control file.</subfield>
