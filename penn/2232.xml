      <subfield code="a">Between 1979 and 1985 WETA-FM conducted a total of 56 "luncheon series" oral history interviews with notable women in the greater Washington, D.C. area. All interviews were a part of a series entitled "Women of Achievement." Each interview is approximately 45 minutes to an hour long and topics included life and work experiences. Interviewees were chosen for their achievements in a wide range of fields, including community volunteering, business, and the arts. The project's director was Elizabeth Campbell, Vice President of Community Affairs. 08-41 is labeled "Audience Questions" and appears to be from an event held by WETA.</subfield>

Following digitization the collection was reprocessed in 2017 with the transcripts being placed in new folders and boxed.
