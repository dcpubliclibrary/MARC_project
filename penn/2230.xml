      <subfield code="a">Processing Information: After the initial donation the Library bound the transcripts and they were then arranged them alphabetically by surname and placed in a filing cabinet for patron use. Tapes were duplicated by the Library with the original being placed into off site deep storage, and patrons given access to the use copy. In 2014 the transcripts were un bound as a part of the digitization process. In 2017 the  transcripts were reprocessed and  placed in new archival folders and boxed. All administrative records, including release documents, were placed into the control files.</subfield>
