      <subfield code="a">The C. Bernard Ruffin Collection is an African-American genealogical collection. The collection references the lives of many prominent families and individuals in the Washington D.C. area, including Dr. Charles Drew, Charlene Drew Jarvis, and Mary Church Terrell. In addition to the family histories featured in the collection, there is an abundance of material regarding the history of the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church in D.C. On November 3, 1841, the Reverend John F. Cook held meetings to establish a Presbyterian church for people of African descent. On November 21, 1841, the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church was officially organized. Born a slave in 1810 and whose aunt bought his freedom in 1826, Cook served to educate his community. In 1834 he took charge of a school located at 14th and H Streets and renamed it Union Seminary and educated those in the Africana community. Cook began studying in for the ministry in 1836, and went on to serve as a minister at several churches in the area. Cook served as the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Churchâ€™s first pastor. He passed away in 1855.
