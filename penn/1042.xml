      <subfield code="a">The Neighbors, Inc. was founded in 1958 to promote integration in neighborhoods in the Upper Northwest Washington, DC neighborhoods of Brightwood, Manor Park, Shepherd Park, and Takoma. Later, efforts were expanded to include all neighborhoods in Ward 4. Northwest Washington Neighbors, Inc. was founded by a group of activists committed to integration and fair housing. The activists had worked with a similar group in Southeast DC. With the help and advice of the SE Neighbors, Inc., they formed the organization that foucused the attention of city officials and the local press on their communities and demonstrated the difficulty in fighting the forces that threatened to destroy their neighborhoods. After schools desegregated with the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court Brown vs. Board of Education decision, there was a "white flight" to the suburbs. This mass movement was encouraged by unscrupulous real estate agents who threatened to purchase houses at low prices by falsely warning residents that their value of their homes would decline or their schools would deteriorate. Methods to accomplish this included renting small houses to large families and telling neighbors that the families had purchased the home. Neighbors, Inc. responded with a two-pronged approach. Using active committees, they found reputable real estate agents who would sell to all homebuyers (white and African American) without discrimination. Integration became more commonplace, the threat of re-segregation lessened, and real estate values continued to rise. The city opened access to secondary schools throughout the District, lessening the pressure to keep residents focused on neighborhood schools. The organization still exists today and has expanded its concentration on local politics, neighborhood revitalization, park and recreation engagement, and citizen engagement.</subfield>
