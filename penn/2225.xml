      <subfield code="a">Processing Information: Prior to their donation to the Library in 1982, the transcripts for these interviews were organized  alphabetically and bound by the Jewish Historical Society. These bound transcripts have been cataloged and added to the Washingtoniana Book Collection.  Tapes were duplicated by the Library with the original being placed into off site deep storage, and patrons given access to the use copy. Indexes and subsequent materials related to the project and the interviews were foldered and placed into a filing cabinet for patron access. Following digitization of the tapes, transcripts and indexes in 2014, the foldered materials were reprocessed and boxed. Indexes were foldered and placed original order. folders were then boxed for long term storage. Master and patron use copies of the audio cassette recording were placed in new archival boxes. Release documents between the interviewee and the Jewish Historical Society were moved to the control file. In 2017, the Jewish Historical Society granted the Library the right to publish the digitized materials on the Library's website.</subfield>

      <subfield code="a">From 1980 – 1981, the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington, D.C., conducted a total of 26 oral history interviews with local Jewish senior citizens to learn about growing up in Washington in the early years of the 20th century as well as the development of the  Jewish community. Topics include arriving and settling in Washington, military service, education, businesses and professions, family relationships, synagogues, traditions and customs, and leisure time activities. Individuals were selected from a cross-section of senior citizens in the Jewish community. Ellen R. Epstein, a Society member and director of the Center for Oral History and Director of the Center for Oral History, trained volunteers to conduct the interviews. The volunteers were Stella Bernstein, Estelle Bossin, Joyce Chaiet, Phyllis Dreyfuss, Tammy Friedman, Suzanne Helfand, and Ida Neviaser. A grant from the D.C. Humanities Council provided funds for transcribing the taped interviews. The timed indexes offer an encapsulated version of topics discussed during specific periods of the taped interviews. In addition, summary pages of topics discussed precede transcripts.</subfield>
