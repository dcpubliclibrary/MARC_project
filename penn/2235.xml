Audio recordings placed a cabinet for patron use. In 2014, the tapes and transcripts were digitized and in 2017 the collection was reprocessed. Transcripts were placed into folders and boxed. All known audio tapes were organized and boxed for long term storage. All administrative documents, including releases, were placed into the control file.</subfield>
