      <subfield code="a">The Static Disruptors was a go-go band founded in the 1980s by Craig Rosen. Rosen grew up in Bethesda, Maryland and attended Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. Prior to Static Disruptors, Rosen was involved in the hardcore music scene, playing with groups such as the Rollins Band. While at Lawrence University, Rosen formed the Static Disruptors in 1980. The band relocated to Washington, D.C. shortly after it was founded and settled on creating and playing go-go music. An all-white band until after its first hit song was released, Static Disruptors learned funk and go-go from the band Mass Extinction, a local D.C. band. In 1982, the group produced their hit “D.C. Groove.” The band became the first go-go act to perform at the 9:30 Club and the first to play with a rock band at Sidwell Friends school. Rosen mixed hard rock and punk throughout his go-go sets. The group found that their music struggled to find an audience because it was too go-go for one set of fans and too hardcore for the other. The Static Disruptors dissolved after only recording one single. Rosen went on to produce and collaborate with the likes of Doug E. Fresh and the Prophecy Band. Rosen left D.C. to study film at Columbia University. The Static Disruptors reunited in 2003 for a brief concert during a reunion weekend at Lawrence University.</subfield>
