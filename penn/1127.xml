      <subfield code="a">This collection contains the research conducted by John Muller for his book Frederick Douglass: The Lion of Anacostia published in 2012. Frederick Douglass spent his last two decades of life in Washington, D.C. Muller explores how Douglass spent his life, professionally and personally in his Anacostia home, Cedar Hill. The ever-active Douglass was involved in local politics: from aiding in the early formation of Howard University to editing a groundbreaking newspaper to serving as marshal of the District. This will be the first work to look into Douglassâ€™ years as a leading citizen of Uniontown when he served as US Marshal, Trustee to Howard University, was a frequent presence at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, and shook up his family and society by marrying Helen Pitts in 1884. During this time, his wife of 44 years, Anna Murray, passed away, and 18 months later, he married Helen Pitts, a white woman. Douglass continued his advocacy for the rights of African Americans and women. Douglass attended a church in Hillsdale until the evening of his death on February 20, 1895.</subfield>
