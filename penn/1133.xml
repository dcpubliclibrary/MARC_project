Arrington Dixon was born in Washington, DC, raised in Anacostia, and attended DC public schools. He attended Birney Elementary School, Douglass Junior High School, and McKinley Technical High School. Dixon served as a cadet in the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in 1967. After his brother, James Dixon, was killed in a Southeast Asia military airplane crash, he returned to Washington, DC and attended Howard University to complete his undergraduate degree in economics and statistics. Dixon went on to earn a law degree from the George Washington University National Law Center and in 1974, was elected to the City Council of the District of Columbia, one of the first members to be seated in the newly-established legislative body. Dixon later ran for Chair of the City Council when colleague and fellow Council member Sterling Tucker ran for Mayor. Dixon won the seat and aided his friend Charlene Drew Jarvis, to secure his vacant seat. In 1982, he sought re-election, but lost to David A. Clarke. Dixon later returned to his passion for technology. He worked for the Brookings Institute and the Computer Systems Group of the Planning Research Corporation, and also later founded ADA, Inc. (Arrington Dixon and Associates). Dixon also served on the Anacostia Coordinating Council to advocate for the construction of a new Metrorail station in that neighborhood. His political career is deemed significant by historians because his championing of the creation of a newly-established DC City Council in 1974 was a direct result of a long struggle to secure Home Rule in the District and many regarded him as a supporter and defender of citizens who were considered to be in a neglected area of the city that was “east of the River.”

Dixon married future District of Columbia Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly in 1966. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1982.</subfield>
